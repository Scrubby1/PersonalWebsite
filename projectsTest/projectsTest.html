                        <h3>Intranet Creation</h3>
                        <p>As part of my work at Full Circle Software (FCS)(See Work Experience for more details) I worked with the company's founder to
                            create training documentation and guides for staff development and training. In this project I worked exclusively remotely, 
                            working independantly to create detailed and thourough step-by-step guides and in-depth documentation for use by all members of 
                            staff, including management.
                        </p>

                        <p>This Project gave me skills in the following areas:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Working independantly helped me to improve my ability to work within given parameters to achieve goals without instruction.
                            </li>
                            <li>Creating documentation for projects in a simple, quick and easy-to-read way that made it simple for users to find the 
                                required information.
                            </li> 
                            <li>Helped me with developing my abilities in regards to considering a product from the perspective of the end user.</li>

                        <p>While working at Full Circle Software (FCS) I worked closely with school management to plan and implement a plan to upgrade the
                            computers at the school. In this project, I worked to survey and analyse the desktops at the school and evaluate whether they
